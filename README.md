# Event-Scheduler-and-Management-System
This project implements a C++ based scheduling system using Min-Heap to efficiently manage priority-based events.

Developed a dynamic task scheduler for adding, removing, and modifying events with optimized time complexity.

Leveraged Min-Heap structures for fast and reliable priority-based event handling.

Integrated file operations to enable event persistence, ensuring seamless saving, retrieval, and synchronization of schedules.

Enhanced usability with features like formatted time conversion, quick event lookups, and robust handling of priority conflicts.

Designed for efficient queue rebuilding, supporting dynamic updates without performance degradation.

This system is ideal for applications requiring real-time scheduling, persistent data management, and reliable conflict resolution.
